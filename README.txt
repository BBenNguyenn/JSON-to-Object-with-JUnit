Completed March 2019
Small academic project to learn about Java interfaces while trying out JUnit testing.

PLEASE NOTE:
- JSONParser.java not done by student
- Compile with JUnit, no main method
- JUnitTests.java contains all tests and is treated as the 'main' with above comment block

- Number of Part 1 Tests: 10
- Number of Part 2 Tests: 10
- Total number of Tests: 20
- All tests passed successfully using JUnit 4

- I did not use packages because I was not sure if it would be
  inconvenient for you, so I made everything in one default package.
  Though, I know information hiding and organization could have
  improved if I used packages, such is the case with the Node class
  where private fields have both setters and getters which is not ideal.
  Please understand that I know this is not proper programming standards
  and using packages would have solved this, though I chose not to for
  both our conveniences.

	Thank you for your regards.
